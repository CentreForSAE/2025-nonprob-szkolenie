"1","A nonprob object
 - estimator type: inverse probability weighting
 - method: logit (mle)
 - auxiliary variables source: population
 - vars selection: false
 - variance estimator: analytic
 - population size fixed: true
 - naive (uncorrected) estimator: 0.6605
 - selected estimator: 0.7042 (se=0.0168, ci=(0.6713, 0.7371))
 - caution: since `pop_size' is provided, the variance is estimated assuming that `pop_size' is known (not estimated). If this assumption is wrong, specify the appropriate `var_method' in the `control_inf()` function.
